# 🐍 Python Sandbox API

[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live_Demo-Online-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge&logo=render)](https://python-exeution.onrender.com)
[![Language](https://img.shields.io/badge/Language-Python-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=python)](https://www.python.org/)

A secure, versatile, and sandboxed Python code execution service exposed via a simple RESTful API. This project allows you to safely execute untrusted Python code in an isolated environment, complete with support for file attachments, standard input, and retrieving output files.

---

## ✨ Live Demo

This application is deployed and live on Render. You can start making requests immediately to the base URL:

https://python-exeution.onrender.com

The documentation and a user-friendly interface are available at the base URL.

> **Note:** The public API is open to everyone but is rate-limited to ensure fair usage and server stability. Please see the [Limits & Restrictions](#-limits--restrictions) section for more details.

## 🚀 Features

-   **Secure Sandboxing**: Code is executed in an isolated, temporary environment with no network access and restricted filesystem permissions.
-   **File I/O**: Attach files to your request, process them in your script, and retrieve generated output files, all in a single API call.
-   **Resource Limiting**: Strict limits on execution time, code length, and process creation prevent abuse and infinite loops.
-   **Curated Libraries**: Access a safe, curated list of popular libraries like `numpy` and `Pillow`, while blocking dangerous modules like `os` or `subprocess`.
-   **Admin Bypass**: Use a secret API key to bypass all public rate limits and import restrictions for trusted administrative tasks.
-   **Detailed Responses**: Get rich context with every request, including your current quota, server load, and request metadata.
-   **Robust Rate Limiting**: Per-IP rate limiting and daily quotas to prevent spam and ensure fair usage.
-   **Concurrency Control**: The server actively manages load, returning a `503 Service Busy` error if too many processes are running concurrently.

## 🛡️ Security Model

Security is the primary design goal. Every execution is constrained by:
-   **No Network Access**: Scripts are blocked from making any outbound network calls.
-   **Filesystem Isolation**: Code runs within a temporary directory that is permanently deleted after execution. Path traversal attacks are prevented, ensuring no access to the host filesystem.
-   **Import Restrictions**: An allowlist of safe modules prevents the use of potentially harmful libraries.
-   **Process Limits**: Protection against "fork bombs" by limiting the number of child processes a script can create.
-   **Ephemeral Environment**: The entire execution context is destroyed after each API call, ensuring no data persists between requests.
-   **Robust IP Detection**: Correctly identifies user IPs even behind a reverse proxy by trusting the `X-Forwarded-For` header.

## 💻 How to Use the API

All examples use `curl` for simplicity. The base URL is `https://python-exeution.onrender.com/execute`.

#### 1. Basic Code Execution
This is the simplest use case, sending only the `code` field.

```bash
curl -X POST https://python-exeution.onrender.com/execute \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "code": "print(f\"The sum is {10 + 25}\")"
}'
```

#### 2. Providing Standard Input (stdin)
Use the `stdin_data` field to pass data to your script.

```bash
curl -X POST https://python-exeution.onrender.com/execute \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "code": "import sys\nname = sys.stdin.read().strip()\nprint(f\"Hello, {name}!\")",
  "stdin_data": "Alice"
}'
```

#### 3. Attaching Files
Provide files in the `attachments` array. The content must be Base64 encoded.

```bash
# First, create a sample file and encode it
echo "This is some sample data." > data.txt
B64_CONTENT=$(base64 -w 0 data.txt)

# Now, make the API call
curl -X POST https://python-exeution.onrender.com/execute \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "code": "with open(\"input.txt\", \"r\") as f:\n  print(f.read().upper())",
  "attachments": [
    {
      "filename": "input.txt",
      "content_base_64": "'"$B64_CONTENT"'"
    }
  ]
}'
```

#### 4. Returning Generated Files
Use `return_files` to specify which files created by your script should be sent back in the response.

```bash
curl -X POST https://python-exeution.onrender.com/execute \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "code": "with open(\"result.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n  f.write(\"Process completed successfully.\")",
  "return_files": ["result.txt"]
}'
```
The response will contain the Base64-encoded content of `result.txt` inside the `execution_details.output_files` object.

#### 5. Using an Admin API Key
Include the `api_key` to bypass rate limits and import restrictions. This allows you to use powerful modules like `os`.

```bash
curl -X POST https://python-exeution.onrender.com/execute \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
  "code": "import os\nprint(f\"Running with {os.cpu_count()} CPU cores available.\")",
  "api_key": "your-secret-api-key-here"
}'
```

## 🔬 Complete Example: Image Grayscaling

This example uploads an image, uses the **Pillow** library to convert it to grayscale, and returns the processed image.

#### 1. The Client-Side Request Script (run locally)
```python
import requests
import base64
import json

API_URL = 'https://python-exeution.onrender.com/execute'
LOCAL_IMAGE_PATH = 'my_photo.jpg' # Make sure this file exists locally
RESULT_IMAGE_PATH = 'result_grayscale.png'

# This script is sent in the 'code' field
sandbox_code = """
from PIL import Image
try:
    with Image.open('input_photo.jpg') as img:
        grayscale_img = img.convert('L')
        grayscale_img.save('output_grayscale.png')
        print("Image successfully converted to grayscale.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
"""

# 1. Read local image and Base64 encode it
try:
    with open(LOCAL_IMAGE_PATH, "rb") as image_file:
        b64_content = base64.b64encode(image_file.read()).decode('utf-8')
except FileNotFoundError:
    print(f"Error: Make sure a file named '{LOCAL_IMAGE_PATH}' exists.")
    exit()

# 2. Construct the API payload
payload = {
    "code": sandbox_code,
    "attachments": [{"filename": "input_photo.jpg", "content_base_64": b64_content}],
    "return_files": ["output_grayscale.png"]
}

# 3. Send the request
response = requests.post(API_URL, json=payload)
response_data = response.json()

# 4. Process the new, detailed response structure
print(f"API Response Code: {response.status_code}")

if response.status_code == 200:
    print("API Call Successful!")
    user_info = response_data.get('user_info', {})
    exec_details = response_data.get('execution_details', {})
    
    print(f"  > Requests remaining today: {user_info.get('requests_remaining_today', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  > Stdout: {exec_details.get('stdout', '').strip()}")
    
    output_files = exec_details.get('output_files', {})
    file_info = output_files.get('output_grayscale.png', {})
    b64_image_content = file_info.get('content_base64')

    if b64_image_content:
        grayscale_data = base64.b64decode(b64_image_content)
        with open(RESULT_IMAGE_PATH, "wb") as f:
            f.write(grayscale_data)
        print(f"  > Success! Grayscale image saved to '{RESULT_IMAGE_PATH}'")
    else:
        print(f"  > Error returning file: {file_info.get('error', 'Unknown file error')}")
else:
    print("API Error Details:")
    print(json.dumps(response_data, indent=2))
```
